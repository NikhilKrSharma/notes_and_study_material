# Data Science and Machine Learning Engineer Quick Revision

## 1. Data Preprocessing:
### Handling Missing Values:
- Identify missing values using visualizations or summary statistics.
- Options: Remove, impute with mean/median/mode, use advanced imputation methods.

### Data Cleaning:
- Address inconsistencies, outliers, and errors in the dataset.
- Techniques: Visualization, statistical methods, domain knowledge.

### Feature Scaling:
- Normalize/Standardize numerical features to ensure uniform scales.
- Common methods: Min-Max scaling, Z-score normalization.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
### Visualizations:
- Use matplotlib, seaborn, or other libraries for histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc.
- EDA techniques help understand data distributions and patterns.

### Statistical Measures:
- Utilize summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for insights.
- Correlation analysis to understand relationships between features.

## 3. Feature Engineering:
### Creating New Features:
- Generate meaningful features from existing ones.
- Techniques: Polynomial features, interaction terms, binning.

### Handling Categorical Variables:
- Convert categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Consider target encoding for high cardinality categorical features.

## 4. Model Selection and Training:
### Classification Models:
- Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors.

### Regression Models:
- Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.

### Ensemble Learning:
- Combine multiple models for improved performance.
- Techniques: Bagging (Random Forest), Boosting (Gradient Boosting), Stacking.

## 5. Model Evaluation:
### Classification Metrics:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
- Confusion matrix for detailed analysis.

### Regression Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.

### Cross-Validation:
- K-Fold Cross-Validation for robust model assessment.

## 6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
### Grid Search:
- Exhaustive search over predefined hyperparameter values.

### Random Search:
- Random sampling of hyperparameter values for efficiency.

### Automated Tuning Tools:
- Utilize tools like GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, Optuna, or Ray Tune.

## 7. Deep Learning:
### Neural Networks:
- Use TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training neural networks.

### Frameworks:
- Keras for high-level neural network API.

## 8. Deployment and Productionization:
### Model Deployment:
- Convert models to APIs using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.

### Scalability:
- Consider containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for scalability.

## 9. Version Control:
### Git:
- Utilize Git for version control and collaboration.

### GitHub/GitLab:
- Host and manage repositories on GitHub or GitLab.

## 10. Big Data and Cloud Platforms:
### Hadoop Ecosystem:
- Understand HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, and Spark.

### Cloud Platforms:
- Familiarity with AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalable computing and storage.

## 11. Monitoring and Maintenance:
### Monitoring:
- Implement monitoring for model performance and data quality.

### Continuous Learning:
- Stay updated with new techniques, tools, and research in data science and machine learning.

## 12. Communication Skills:
### Visualization:
- Use tools like Tableau or Matplotlib to communicate findings visually.

### Storytelling:
- Effectively communicate results and insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
